# AutoClicker-Base
Before doing anything extract the clicker base, you will find siticone.ui.dll inside(reasons cause i used siticone instead of imgui at the end of readme.md) <br />
Base to Code an External AutoClicker (Easy to Understand For Everyone, especially all people who loves skidding... maybe) <br />
Inside This sln you will find the code for an Autoclicker that works on Minecraft (Comments will Guide you) <br />
Features: <br />
Smart Mode (Disable In Invetory) <br />
Extra Randomization (I don't suggest to use that but to figure out your own, Physiological AC uses a private methods for most functions) <br />
Jitter with multiplier (Shake Effect) <br />
BlockHit with chance (Blockhits for you) <br />
Spike with chance. <br />
If you love skidding, probably you'll find out a lot of things there, but let me give you a suggestion don't skid randomization if you don't want people to get banned.  <br />
Made with Siticone.UI.dll,C++ clr and .Net framework 4.7.2 cause i love annoying dotpeeks users that disassembles codes (If you use dotpeeks to disassemble the .exe it will result that is a C# code. It actually isn't. That's due of cli .NET)
